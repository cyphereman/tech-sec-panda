## Summary 

This file contains steps to refresh the SSAS Models with historical loads.

## 1. Data Model for SSAS.
Please ensure that you have created the SSAS models and configured them in the Job Manager as indicated in [Configure SQL Server Analysis Services](./8-Configure%20SQL%20Server%20Analysis%20Services.md)

## 2. Locate the Partition Builder Machine.
* Login into [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and locate your resource group. In the list of resources search for the partition builder Virtual Machine ending in the string "ssaspbvm00".
* Remote Desktop into the Machine using your credentials.
* Start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to Analysis Server.
* Process the Model for full refresh.

## 3. Copy database to SSAS Read-Only nodes
There are multiple ways you can sync up the SSAS tabular model from Partition builder to SSAS Read-Only nodes. One way is to backup the [database and restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/backup-and-restore-of-analysis-services-databases) on each Read-Only node. Another option is to use the following [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/synchronize-analysis-services-databases).
