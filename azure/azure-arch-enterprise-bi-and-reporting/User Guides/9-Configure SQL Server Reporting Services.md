# Configuring Reporting Services
**SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** is part of Microsoft SQL Server services - SSRS, SSAS and SSIS. It is a server-based report generating software system that can create, deploy and manage traditional and mobile ready paginated reports via a modern web portal.

> Read more about [SQL Server Reporting Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Reporting_Services) and find [documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/create-deploy-and-manage-mobile-and-paginated-reports).

## Connect to SSRS Web Portal
Deploying the solution, provisions two SSRS virtual machines front-ended by an [Azure Load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/load-balancer/) for high availability and performance. Follow the next steps to connect to the SSRS admin web-portal.  
1. Obtain the **SSRS** load balancer url from the deployment summary page.
    > *e.g.* `http://<your-prefix>ssrslb.ciqsedw.ms/reports`.

    ![ssrs-url](../img/reportingserver_assets/ssrs-url.png)

2. Browse to the SSRS load balancer url.
3. Enter the admin credentials on the prompt. 
	- Username name **must** be a user that can authenticate against the SQL Server in the format **domain\username**. For instance `ciqsedw\edwadmin`. 
	- Password is the SSRS admin password.

4. If everything works correctly, you should now have successfully authenticated and can access the reports and data sources.

## Subscribing to Reports via Email
> This step is not automated by the solution, however, you can manually configure a custom SMTP server, such as SendGrid.

### 1. Create SendGrid SMTP account on Azure
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search the market place for **SendGrid Email Delivery**.
3. Create a new SendGrid account.

5. Go to **All settings** -> **Configurations**. Get the following:
	- Username 
	- Password
	- SMTP Server address

    ![Configuration Parameters](../img/reportingserver_assets/sendgrid-config.png)  

> **NOTE:** Password is the same one created when the SendGrid account was created. 

### 2. Enter SendGrid credentials into Reporting Server
1. Connect to both of your **SSRS Servers** using Remote Desktop.
2. Open the **Reporting Services Configuration Manager**.
3. Connect to the server instance.

   ![SSRS Instance](../img/reportingserver_assets/ssrs-instance.png)

4. On the left tabs, click on `Email Settings` and fill out the following
	- Sender email address
	- SMTP Server (smtp.sendgrid.net)
	- Username 
	- Password/Confirm Password

    ![SSRS Information](../img/reportingserver_assets/ssrs-email.png)

5. Click Apply. 

> **Note:** There is no need to restart the Reporting Server service. It takes the most recent configuration.

1. Navigate to the Reporting Server web portal
